# todo
- somehow make it cross-platform
  - if it fails, use git branches (windows & linux) and one master branch to rebase upon
- look trough nvim to see what else i'm missing

# todo plugins
- vim-motions plugin
- better terminal plugin
- include dependencies here (maybe)
- don't like the search and replace (native with keys); replace it with a vim-like one
