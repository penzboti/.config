# todo
- scope.nvim save state (i have no idea what this means now)
- move similar plugins to one file: commentary & todo; ufo & statuscol
- unmentioned todo-s ```<leader>ft``` (will be the default if the place for it is present)
- cpp errors that are not actually errors
# info

# shada error
windows: delete .tmp in: %LOCALAPPDATA%/nvim-data/shada
linux: delete .tmp in: .local/share/nvim/shada (i think)
