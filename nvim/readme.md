- scope.nvim save state
- lualine & tabline: file naming on top, remove from bottom; maybe move the command bar
- move similar plugins to one file: commentary & todo; ufo & statuscol
- unmentioned todo-s ```<leader>ft``` (will be the default if the place for it is present)
# info
buffers are set up to function like traditional tabs
# shada error
windows: delete .tmp in: %LOCALAPPDATA%/nvim-data/shada
linux: delete .tmp in: .local/share/nvim/shada (i think)
