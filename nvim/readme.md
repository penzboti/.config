# todo
decide between tabs and buffers
## currently
buffers
if tabs happen, manually close them
## tabs
can make multiple windows in a tab (so split view) and then you can have multiple tabs
## buffers
for some reason it saves the last buffer so it also works
i think this is what i'll stick with
# issue
the lua autoformatter uses tabs instead of spaces
