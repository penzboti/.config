# info
- these are my cross-platform & linux-platform only configs.
## linux configs
- added linux only config files aswell (if i ever move off of nixos)
- you can view my system configuration aswell in a separate repo (nixos)
## static configs
- since, i'm not using them, they practically won't change
- so just not symlinked
- zed & vscode

# ideas to include
- nushell, if i like it
- powershell (not very cross-platform is it (but then fish??))
- godot (can't really config that)
- visual studio & jetbrains IDES (intellij)
