# info
- these are my cross-platform configs.
- my linux config is fully in nix, and that is a different repo.
- hyprland; hyprpaper; hyprlock in nix-config (still a todo)
- waybar config is a separate repo, bc its a fork (that would also be a nix only thing)

# todo
- vscode config
- zed config (even if it is unfinished)
- ghostty?
- nushell && fish?
- gitui?
