# info
- these are my cross-platform configs.
- my linux config is fully in nix, and that is a different repo.
- hyprland; hyprpaper; hyprlock in nix-config (still a todo)
- waybar config is a separate repo, bc its a fork (that would also be a nix only thing)
- zed was untouched for at least half a year atp

# todo
- vscode config
- nushell if i like it
