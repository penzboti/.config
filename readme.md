# info
- these are my cross-platform configs.
## linux configs
- fully in nix, and that is a different repo.
  - waybar config is a separate repo, bc its a fork (that would also be a nix only thing)
## static configs
- since, i'm not using them, they practically won't change
- so just not symlinked
- zed & vscode

# ideas to include
- nushell, if i like it
- powershell (not very cross-platform is it (but then fish??))
- godot (can't really config that)
- visual studio & jetbrains IDES (intellij)
